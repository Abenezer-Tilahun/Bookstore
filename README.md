- ESlint (A mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in JavaScript codes)
- Redux
- GitFlow.
- NPM.

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

The basic requirements for building the executable are:

- A working browser application (Google chrome, Mozilla Fire fox, Microsoft edge ...)
- VSCode or any other equivalent code editor
- Node Package Manager (For installing packages like Lighthous, webhint & stylelint used for checking for debugging bad codes before deployment)
